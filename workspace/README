CHANGES
  20150218 - (Eric) Created working Date class. string copy constructor still doesn't work (outside of VS) but that's okay just turn
  stuff like Date newDate = "20150218"; into something like Date newDate; newDate = "20150218"; All inequality operators turn Date objects into
  integers and compare them. (Most recent git push to newDate_h branch)
  
  20150219 - (John) Created two classes for the assigned and completed assignments. Created a Node struct, changed the assignment.h to a struct. Created a linked list class. Implemented fucntions based on project instructions
